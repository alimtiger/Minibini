# EstWorksheet Implementation Summary

## **Implementation Details**

### **Template-Based TaskMapping Architecture**
The system successfully uses a template-based approach where:
- **TaskMapping** objects are reusable templates
- **TaskTemplate** objects reference TaskMapping for behavior
- **TaskInstanceMapping** provides per-task overrides when needed
- **Task** objects inherit mapping behavior from their templates

### **Mapping Strategies Implemented**
1. **Direct Mapping** - One task becomes one line item (e.g., consultation)
2. **Bundle to Product** - Multiple tasks bundled into one product line item (e.g., cabinet manufacturing)
3. **Bundle to Service** - Multiple tasks bundled into one service line item (e.g., delivery)
4. **Exclude** - Internal tasks excluded from customer estimates (e.g., QA)
