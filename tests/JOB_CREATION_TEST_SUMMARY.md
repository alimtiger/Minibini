# Job Creation Test Coverage Summary

## Test Files
1. **tests/test_jobs_models.py** - Model-level tests for Job creation
2. **tests/test_job_creation_views.py** - View-level tests for Job creation form

## Core Requirements Tested

### 1. Current Timestamp Requirement ✅
- **Test**: `test_job_creation_timestamp_is_current`
- **Verifies**: Every new Job is created with a current timestamp in `created_date`
- **Method**: Checks that `created_date` falls between timestamps taken before and after creation

### 2. Draft Status Requirement ✅
- **Tests**:
  - `test_job_default_status_is_draft` - Model level
  - `test_job_default_values` - Model level
  - `test_job_always_starts_in_draft_status` - View level
- **Verifies**: All new Jobs start in 'draft' status by default
- **Coverage**: Tests both when status is not specified and when someone tries to override it

### 3. Contact Association Requirement ✅
- **Tests**:
  - `test_job_requires_contact` - Tests that Job creation fails without contact field
  - `test_job_contact_cannot_be_none` - Tests that contact=None is rejected
  - `test_job_minimal_creation_requirements` - Verifies contact is required
  - `test_job_create_missing_contact_fails` - View level validation
- **Verifies**: A Job must always have a valid Contact associated with it
- **Method**: Uses IntegrityError assertions at model level, form validation at view level

## Additional Test Coverage

### Model Tests (test_jobs_models.py)
- Basic job creation with all fields
- String representation (`__str__` method)
- Default values for optional fields
- Status choices validation
- Completed date handling
- Due date handling (new field)
- Minimal creation requirements

### View Tests (test_job_creation_views.py)
- GET request rendering
- Pre-selected contact from query parameter
- Successful POST with all fields
- POST with due date
- Form validation for missing required fields
- Auto-generation of job numbers
- Redirect to detail page after creation
- Integration with Contact detail page link

## Test Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 53 (including other model tests)
- **Job-specific Tests**: ~20
- **All Tests Status**: ✅ PASSING

## Key Validations Confirmed

1. ✅ **Timestamp is always current**: The `created_date` field uses `timezone.now` as default
2. ✅ **Status always starts as 'draft'**: Model default is 'draft', cannot be overridden on creation
3. ✅ **Contact is mandatory**: Database constraint (NOT NULL) and form validation both enforce this
4. ✅ **Job number is required**: Form validation ensures unique job number
5. ✅ **Due date is optional**: Can be null/blank
6. ✅ **Completed date starts as null**: Only set when job is completed

## Integration Points Tested
- Creating job from main menu "Add Job" link
- Creating job from Contact detail page with pre-selected contact
- Form auto-generates next job number in sequence
- Successful redirect to job detail page after creation

## Database Constraints Verified
- `contact` field: NOT NULL constraint (ForeignKey with on_delete=CASCADE)
- `job_number`: Unique constraint
- `created_date`: Auto-populated with current timestamp
- `status`: Default value 'draft' from choices

## Form Validation Verified
- Required fields: job_number, contact
- Optional fields: description, customer_po_number, due_date
- Pre-population: Contact can be pre-selected via query parameter
- Auto-generation: Job number follows pattern JOB-YYYY-NNNN
